## üì¢ Note
- All problems are selected from real-world coding platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **HackerRank**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **InterviewBit**, etc.
- Priority is given to **logical building**, **optimization**, and **clean code writing**.
- Some problems may have **multiple approaches** discussed inside the code.
